V11, a small, fast, and efficient JavaScript(ish) engine was built to power the next generation of assistive tools and services. The engine exposes accessibility tooling and programming interfaces in a language that abstracts platform-dependent requirements into a Document Object Model-inspired platform. Just like the web, it's easy to learn for beginners, and powerful enough for the most experienced developers.","spans":[]}],"post_author":"T. B.
