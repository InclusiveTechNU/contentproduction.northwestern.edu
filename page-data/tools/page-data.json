V11, a JavaScript library was built to power the next generation of assistive tools and workflows. The engine exposes accessibility and automation programming interfaces in a language that abstracts complex actions into a simple tree for querying and manipulating. Just like the web, it's easy to learn for beginners, and powerful enough for the most experienced developers.","spans":[]}],"post_author":"T. B.
