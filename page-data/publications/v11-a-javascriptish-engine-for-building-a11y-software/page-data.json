V11, a small, fast, and efficient JavaScript(ish) engine was built to power the next generation of assistive tools and services. The engine exposes accessibility tooling and programming interfaces in a language that abstracts platform-dependent requirements into a Document Object Model-inspired platform. Just like the web, it's easy to learn for beginners, and powerful enough for the most experienced developers.","spans":[]}],"_meta":{"uid":"v11-a-javascriptish-engine-for-building-a11y-software"}}}]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Northwestern University","description":"Next Generation Content Production Tools for People with Vision Impairments.","author":"Northwestern Inclusive Technology Lab, Interactive Audio Lab, and Collab Lab"}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"v11-a-javascriptish-engine-for-building-a11y-software","rootQuery":"\n    query PostQuery($uid: String) {\n        prismic {\n            allPosts(uid: $uid) {\n                edges {\n                    node {\n                        post_title\n                        post_hero_image\n                        post_hero_annotation\n                        post_date\n                        post_category\n                        post_body\n                        post_author\n                        post_preview_description\n                        _meta {\n                            uid\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        site {\n            siteMetadata {\n                title\n                description\n                author\n            }\n        }\n    }\n"}}}
