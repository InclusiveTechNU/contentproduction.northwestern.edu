In this paper, we focus on audio equalizers. We seek to make a tactile interface that lets blind or visually impaired users create an equalization curve in an intuitive manner. This interface should also promote collaboration between blind and sighted users. Our primary goals were to make something easy to install and intuitively understandable for both sighted and blind users. The result of this research is the HaptEQ system.","spans":[]}],"_meta":{"uid":"hapteq-a-collaborative-tool-for-visually-impaired"}}}]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Northwestern University","description":"Next Generation Content Production Tools for People with Vision Impairments.","author":"Northwestern Inclusive Technology Lab, Interactive Audio Lab, and Collab Lab"}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"hapteq-a-collaborative-tool-for-visually-impaired","rootQuery":"\n    query PostQuery($uid: String) {\n        prismic {\n            allPosts(uid: $uid) {\n                edges {\n                    node {\n                        post_title\n                        post_hero_image\n                        post_hero_annotation\n                        post_date\n                        post_category\n                        post_body\n                        post_author\n                        post_preview_description\n                        _meta {\n                            uid\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        site {\n            siteMetadata {\n                title\n                description\n                author\n            }\n        }\n    }\n"}}}
