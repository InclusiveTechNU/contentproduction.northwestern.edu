With this has come an interest in increasing the accessibility of making for people with disabilities, which has mainly emphasized independence and empowerment through the creation of more accessible fabrication tools. To understand and rethink the notion of accessible making, we analyze the context and practices of a particular site of making: the communal weaving studio within an assisted living facility for people with vision impairments. Our analysis helps reconsider the material and social processes that constitute accessible making, including the ways makers attend to interactive material properties, negotiate co-creative embodied work, and value the labor of making. We discuss future directions for design and research on accessible making while highlighting tensions around assistance, collaboration, and how disabled labor is valued.","spans":[]}],"_meta":{"uid":"weaving-by-touch"}}}]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Northwestern University","description":"Next Generation Content Production Tools for People with Vision Impairments.","author":"Northwestern Inclusive Technology Lab, Interactive Audio Lab, and Collab Lab"}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"weaving-by-touch","rootQuery":"\n    query PostQuery($uid: String) {\n        prismic {\n            allPosts(uid: $uid) {\n                edges {\n                    node {\n                        post_title\n                        post_hero_image\n                        post_hero_annotation\n                        post_date\n                        post_category\n                        post_body\n                        post_author\n                        post_preview_description\n                        _meta {\n                            uid\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        site {\n            siteMetadata {\n                title\n                description\n                author\n            }\n        }\n    }\n"}}}
