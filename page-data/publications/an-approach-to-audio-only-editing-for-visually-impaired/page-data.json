This poster describes the design of an accessible audio-based interface for post-processing audio content created by visually impaired seniors. We conducted a diary study with five older adults with vision impairments to understand how to design a system that would allow them to edit content they record using an audio-only interface. Our findings can help inform the development of accessible audio-editing interfaces for people with vision impairments more broadly.","spans":[]}],"_meta":{"uid":"an-approach-to-audio-only-editing-for-visually-impaired"}}}]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Northwestern University","description":"Next Generation Content Production Tools for People with Vision Impairments.","author":"Northwestern Inclusive Technology Lab, Interactive Audio Lab, and Collab Lab"}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"an-approach-to-audio-only-editing-for-visually-impaired","rootQuery":"\n    query PostQuery($uid: String) {\n        prismic {\n            allPosts(uid: $uid) {\n                edges {\n                    node {\n                        post_title\n                        post_hero_image\n                        post_hero_annotation\n                        post_date\n                        post_category\n                        post_body\n                        post_author\n                        post_preview_description\n                        _meta {\n                            uid\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        site {\n            siteMetadata {\n                title\n                description\n                author\n            }\n        }\n    }\n"}}}
